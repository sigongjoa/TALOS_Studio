feat: Implement initial PoC pipeline structure and documentation

This commit introduces the foundational structure for the Manga to 3D PoC pipeline,
including core scripts, configuration, and a comprehensive testing setup.

Key changes include:
- **Core Pipeline (`run_pipeline.py`):** Implemented the main orchestration script with
  placeholder functions for view synthesis, 3D reconstruction, rendering, and packaging.
- **Configuration (`config.yml`):** Added a central configuration file for pipeline parameters.
- **Dependencies (`requirements.txt`):** Initialized Python dependency list.
- **Testing Infrastructure (`tests/`):** Created unit, integration, and acceptance test
  directories with placeholder tests to validate pipeline components and end-to-end flow.
- **CI/CD Workflows (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `deploy.yml`):** Established GitHub Actions
  workflows for continuous integration (fast tests) and continuous deployment (full pipeline
  execution and GitHub Pages deployment), explicitly excluding Docker.
- **Documentation Updates:**
    - `detailed_specifications.md`: Added concrete environment specifications and referenced
      the new JSON schema for data contracts.
    - `ci_cd_deployment_plan.md`: Revised to reflect a non-Docker CI/CD strategy, clarified
      CI/CD scope, and updated deployment artifacts to include multi-view images.
    - `definition_of_done.md`: Clarified the scope of performance DoD.
    - `process_and_workflow.md`: Replaced abstract data flow diagram with a detailed
      textual description and added a manual local development environment setup guide.
- **Data Schema (`docs/manga_to_3d_pipeline_feasibility/schemas/step1_output_schema.json`):
  Created a concrete JSON schema for the output of the view synthesis step.

This commit addresses the critical inconsistencies and ambiguities identified in the
project's documentation, providing a clear and actionable blueprint for further development.
