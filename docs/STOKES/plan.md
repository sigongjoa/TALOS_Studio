# STOKES - Effect Agent Plan

- **Objective:** Generate VFX layers for smoke, fire, fluids, and magical effects.
- **Core Tech:** Utilize a Navier-Stokes solver, Blender's Mantaflow, and particle simulation systems.
- **Phase 1:** Integrate a basic particle simulator for simple effects.
- **Phase 2:** Implement Mantaflow automation for fluid simulations (smoke, water).
- **Phase 3:** Research and integrate a dedicated Navier-Stokes solver for high-fidelity effects.
