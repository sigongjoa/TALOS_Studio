# ECHO - Feedback Agent Plan

- **Objective:** Evaluate the final video and trigger revisions by identifying areas for improvement.
- **Core Tech:** Use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP and GPT-Vision.
- **Phase 1:** Use a VLM to analyze frames and generate descriptive captions.
- **Phase 2:** Develop a system to compare generated content against the initial prompt's intent.
- **Phase 3:** Implement a mechanism to trigger other agents for revisions (e.g., inpainting, color adjustment).
