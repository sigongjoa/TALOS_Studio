# Phase 7, Step 6: AXIS Backend and Frontend Viewer Integration Summary

## 1. Objective

To visualize the output data (`scene_data.json`) generated by the Python-based AXIS backend pipeline within the existing `axis-interactive-timing-editor` React frontend.

## 2. Process and Challenges

The integration process involved a significant course correction based on a clearer understanding of the project's requirements.

### 2.1. Initial (Incorrect) Approach: UI Replacement

Based on a literal interpretation of the initial design documents (`5_Frontend_Implementation_Plan.md`), the first attempt involved completely replacing the existing complex React UI with a new, minimal vanilla JavaScript viewer. 

- **Action:** `index.html` and `App.tsx` were overwritten, and a new `visualizer.js` was created.
- **Problem:** This approach was fundamentally flawed as it discarded the sophisticated, feature-rich UI that the user intended to keep. The goal was **integration**, not **replacement**.

### 2.2. Corrected Approach: Surgical Integration

After receiving user feedback, a new strategy was adopted to integrate the backend data while preserving the existing UI.

1.  **Revert Changes:** The first step was to revert the destructive changes by using `git restore` to recover the original `index.html` and `App.tsx`.

2.  **Analyze Data Structures:** A detailed analysis was performed to compare the backend data structure (`scene_data.json`, a frame-by-frame list of line coordinates) with the frontend's expected data structure (`MOCK_SCENE`, a semantic object model with keyframes and interpolation curves).

3.  **Modify Rendering Component:** The core of the solution was to modify the rendering logic. Instead of trying to transform the data, we modified the component that draws the data.
    -   **`App.tsx` Modification:**
        -   A `useEffect` hook was added to fetch `/scene_data.json` upon component mount.
        -   The fetched data is stored in a new state variable, `lineData`.
        -   `lineData` is passed as a prop to the `SceneLayoutView` component.
    -   **`SceneLayoutView.tsx` Modification:**
        -   The component was updated to accept the new `lineData` prop.
        -   The `useEffect` hook responsible for rendering was completely rewritten.
        -   The new logic **ignores the old `scene` prop** for drawing purposes. It now directly reads the `lineData` for the `currentFrame` and draws the pre-calculated lines onto the canvas.

### 2.3. Debugging: Browser Cache Issue

After applying the correct code changes, the visual output in the browser did not change. Investigation revealed that the data was being fetched successfully (HTTP 200), but the browser was still rendering the old, cached version of the `SceneLayoutView` component. 

- **Resolution:** The issue was resolved by performing a **hard refresh** (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`), which forced the browser to download the latest versions of the component files.

## 3. Outcome

The integration was successful. The `axis-interactive-timing-editor` now correctly displays the tracked line data generated by the AXIS backend pipeline while keeping its full UI intact. 

The final changes were committed and pushed to the `origin/master` branch under the commit hash `695a6e5`.
