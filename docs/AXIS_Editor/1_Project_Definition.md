# 1. Project Definition: AXIS Visualizer & Timing Editor

## 1.1. Overview
This document defines the high-level goals and vision for the AXIS Visualizer & Timing Editor, a web-based tool designed to inspect and control the output of the AXIS data pipeline.

## 1.2. Core Goal
The ultimate goal is to create not just a data viewer, but an **interactive tool for controlling animation timing and spacing**, inspired by the principles of traditional animation. The tool will evolve into a lightweight, web-based version of a digital "Dope Sheet" and "Graph Editor" tailored specifically for the data generated by the AXIS pipeline.

## 1.3. Phased Approach
To manage complexity, this project adopts a "Viewer First" strategy.

- **Phase 1: Foundational Viewer (Immediate Goal):** The initial priority is to build a robust tool that can accurately visualize the pipeline's current output. This involves displaying the source video synchronized with an overlay of the tracked 2D lines. The primary purpose of this phase is to **verify the integrity and temporal consistency of the line tracking algorithm.**

- **Phase 2: Interactive Editor (Long-term Vision):** Once the viewer is established and the data pipeline is verified, the tool will be extended with editing capabilities. This includes features like a timeline/dope sheet to adjust the timing of entire lines and a graph editor to manipulate the spacing (easing) of a line's movement.

## 1.4. Key Success Metrics for Phase 1
- The viewer must be able to load and parse the `scene_data.json` file generated by the backend.
- The 2D line overlay must render in perfect synchronization with the playback of the source video.
- The color-coding of lines based on their `line_id` must remain consistent across frames, providing a clear visual indicator of tracking success.
