# 3D Model Generation Project Plan

## Initial Attempt: Wonder3D (Abandoned)

The initial plan was to use the Wonder3D project. However, after significant effort, the setup was abandoned due to insurmountable dependency conflicts, primarily between the required versions of PyTorch, CUDA, and other libraries like xformers.

## New Plan: Sequential Evaluation of Alternatives

We will now proceed by evaluating several alternative single-image-to-3D-model libraries in sequence. The goal is to find a library that is both effective and can be reliably integrated into our CI/CD pipeline.

The evaluation will proceed in the following order:

### 1. TripoSR
*   **Status:** Success
*   **Summary:** The environment was set up successfully, and the model was run on a sample image. The output `mesh.obj` and `render.mp4` were generated and saved to the correct deployment directory.
*   **Repository Location:** `/mnt/d/progress/TALOS_Studio/line_detection_comparison/TripoSR`
*   **Output Location:** `/mnt/d/progress/TALOS_Studio/output_for_deployment/triposr-output-temp`

### 2. Magic123
*   **Status:** Pending
*   **Plan:**
    1.  Set up the environment.
    2.  Run the model and evaluate the results.
    3.  If successful and TripoSR fails, proceed to CI/CD integration.

### 3. Zero123++
*   **Status:** Pending
*   **Plan:**
    1.  Set up the environment.
    2.  Run the model and evaluate the results.
    3.  If successful and previous alternatives fail, proceed to CI/CD integration.

### 4. 2D-to-3D-Image-Converter
*   **Status:** Pending
*   **Plan:**
    1.  Set up the environment.
    2.  Run the model and evaluate the results.
    3.  If successful and previous alternatives fail, proceed to CI/CD integration.

## Next Steps

We have successfully evaluated **TripoSR**. We can now proceed with the next step, which could be evaluating the next model, or something else.
