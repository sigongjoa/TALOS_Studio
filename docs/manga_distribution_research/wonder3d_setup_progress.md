# Wonder3D Setup Progress

## Goal
Set up the local environment for the Wonder3D project to generate 3D models from single 2D images, as a first step towards the CI/CD deployment pipeline outlined in `wonder3d_deployment_plan.md`.

## Progress and Challenges

### 1. Environment Creation
- A Conda environment named `wonder3d` with Python 3.10 was successfully created.

### 2. Dependency Installation
- The initial attempt to install dependencies from `requirements.txt` failed due to several conflicts:
    - **`PyMCubes` vs. NumPy:** The version of `PyMCubes` in `requirements.txt` is incompatible with recent versions of NumPy. This was resolved by installing an older version of NumPy.
    - **`xformers` vs. PyTorch vs. CUDA:** This is the main blocking issue.
        - The system has CUDA 12.0.
        - `tiny-cuda-nn` requires a PyTorch version compiled for CUDA 12.x.
        - The `xformers` version in `requirements.txt` (`0.0.16`) requires an older PyTorch version (`1.13.1`) that was compiled with CUDA 11.7.
        - This creates a dependency conflict that prevents a successful installation.

## Proposed Solution
To resolve the dependency conflicts, the following steps are proposed:
1.  Install a version of PyTorch compatible with CUDA 12.1.
2.  Install a newer version of `xformers` that is compatible with the new PyTorch.
3.  Install the remaining dependencies from `requirements.txt`, excluding the conflicting packages.
4.  Install `tiny-cuda-nn`.

## Next Steps
Once the local environment is successfully set up and we can run the 3D generation pipeline, we will proceed with the CI/CD integration and deployment to GitHub Pages as described in the `wonder3d_deployment_plan.md`.
