# FLUX - Inbetween Agent Plan

- **Objective:** Create smooth, interpolated frames between keyframes to generate fluid motion.
- **Core Tech:** Use a combination of RIFE for frame interpolation, temporal diffusion, and optical flow.
- **Phase 1:** Implement RIFE for basic inbetweening.
- **Phase 2:** Research and integrate temporal diffusion for more complex motion.
- **Phase 3:** Use optical flow to enhance motion consistency.
